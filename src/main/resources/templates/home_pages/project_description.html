        <h3>Short description</h3>
        <p class="text-break text-wrap text-center ps-5 pe-5">BuildBoard is intended to be a social platform focused on
            software
            developers. The idea is to facilitate open discussions about technologies, approaches to problems, and more,
            making it accessible to every software developer. Additionally, the application offers an integrated project
            management system where multiple software developers can collaborate and build their own applications. The
            goal is to create a single platform where people can talk, learn, and discuss software development while
            also having the opportunity to explore real projects and connect with the developers behind them, whether
            for consultation or collaboration purposes.</p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <div>
            <p class="ps-5 mb-0 pe-5 text-break text-wrap text-center">
                In today's world, there is an endless number of resources and ways for someone to acquire knowledge. The
                problem
                does not lie in the abundance of available knowledge but in the guidance, specifically, how to achieve
                the
                desired outcome. Every solution to a problem has its own path to reach the goal. This project aims to
                solve
                the
                issue of guidance by enabling software developers to guide and assist one another.
            </p>
            <p class="pe-5 ps-5 text-break text-wrap text-center">
                Another issue being addressed is the problem of centralization. This issue is closely related to the
                aforementioned one, as it is much easier to guide someone who wants to learn if all the necessary
                resources
                are
                in one place. On our platform, this is reflected through various informative threads and discussion
                threads.
